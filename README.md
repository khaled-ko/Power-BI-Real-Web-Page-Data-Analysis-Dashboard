# Power BI Real Web Page Data Analysis Dashboard


This project involves extracting, cleaning, and transforming real web page data, such as page views, new users, and session durations, to build an interactive and insightful dashboard. Designing visualizations like pie and line charts to highlight key metrics and user behavior patterns. The goal is to provide actionable insights for optimizing web performance and improving user experience. Through this project, I'm honing my skills in data integration, Power BI functionalities, and web analytics, while also learning to present data in a clear and impactful way for stakeholders.
